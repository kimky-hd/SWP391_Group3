## Files Modified

### Database

- `blog_content_update.sql` - Created update script for existing databases

### Java Backend
- `src/java/DAO/BlogDAO.java` - Updated all blog-related CRUD methods
- `src/java/Util/StaffBlogManager.java` - Modified createBlog method return type
- `src/java/Model/Blog.java` - Already had content field support

### Frontend
- `web/staff/blog-create.jsp` - Added image upload functionality and multipart form
- `web/staff/blog-detail.jsp` - Added missing fn taglib import
- `web/css/staff-blog.css` - Added image preview and file input styles

## Usage Instructions

### For New Installations
1. Use the updated `SQL.sql` file to create the database schema

### For Existing Installations
1. Run the `blog_content_update.sql` script to add the missing content field
2. Restart your application server to load the updated classes

### Creating a Blog with Images
1. Navigate to the blog creation page
2. Fill in the title and content (both required)
3. Select one or multiple image files using the file input
4. Preview the selected images in the preview area
5. Submit the form to create the blog with images

## Technical Notes

### Image Upload Process
1. Images are uploaded as multipart form data
2. Each image is validated for type and size
3. Images are saved to `/img/blog/` directory with UUID-based filenames
4. Image records are created in the `blogImg` table with references to the blog
5. The first uploaded image can be set as the main image

### Error Handling
- File type validation prevents unsupported formats
- Server-side error handling for file I/O operations
- Database transaction handling for blog and image creation
- User feedback for successful uploads and error conditions

### Security Considerations
- File type validation prevents executable file uploads
- UUID-based filenames prevent path traversal attacks
- Staff permission checks prevent unauthorized access
- Proper error handling prevents information disclosure
