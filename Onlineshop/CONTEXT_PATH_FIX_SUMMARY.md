# Context Path Fix Summary

## Issue
The shipper update-status requests were going to:
`http://localhost:8080/shipper/update-status`

Instead of:
`http://localhost:8080/Onlineshop/shipper/update-status`

## Root Cause
1. The `getContextPath()` function in JavaScript files was not correctly extracting the context path
2. CSS and JS files in `manager_topbarsidebar.jsp` were using hardcoded relative paths without context path
3. Browser caching was preventing updated JavaScript files from loading

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed CSS/JS paths in manager_topbarsidebar.jsp
- Changed all CSS links from `css/filename.css` to `${pageContext.request.contextPath}/css/filename.css`
- Changed all JS links from `js/filename.js` to `${pageContext.request.contextPath}/js/filename.js`

### 2. Fixed getContextPath() function
**Before:**
```javascript
function getContextPath() {
    const path = window.location.pathname;
    const contextPath = path.substring(0, path.indexOf('/', 1));
    return contextPath || '';
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
function getContextPath() {
    // For this application, the context path is always /Onlineshop
    return '/Onlineshop';
}
```

### 3. Fixed mobile-navigation.js variable conflict
- Changed `const style` to `const noScrollStyle` to avoid duplicate variable declarations

### 4. Added cache-busting to JavaScript includes
- Added timestamp parameters to force browser to reload updated JS files
- `shipper-orders.js?v=<%= System.currentTimeMillis() %>`

### 5. Added inline script override
- Added inline script in JSP files to override getContextPath function before other scripts load

## Files Modified
1. `/web/manager_topbarsidebar.jsp`
2. `/web/js/shipper-orders.js`
3. `/web/js/shipper-dashboard.js`
4. `/web/js/mobile-navigation.js`
5. `/web/shipper/shipper_orders.jsp`
6. `/web/shipper/shipper_dashboard.jsp`

## Testing
- Created test JSPs: `test-context-path.jsp`, `quick-test.jsp`
- All URLs should now correctly use `/Onlineshop` context path

## Status Transition Logic (Previously Fixed)
- Status 2 (Approved) → Status 9 (Ready to ship)
- Status 9 (Ready to ship) → Status 3 (Shipping)  
- Status 3 (Shipping) → Status 4 (Delivered) OR Status 6 (Cancelled with note)
- Only Status 3 can be cancelled

## Expected Result
- All AJAX requests should now use correct URLs with `/Onlineshop` context path
- No more 404 errors for CSS/JS resources
- Status updates should work correctly
- No more JavaScript syntax errors
